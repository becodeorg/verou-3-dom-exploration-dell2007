# Dery-s-collection
In my collection project, I decided to show my Mario Bros game collection that joined since I was a child until now.

For the Js file I created a constant with all the information of my collection, then use a for of loop where I created a div with a card class to spread all the information and inside appended the information from my collection.

For the CSS file I decided to work with grid and style it with a basic background related to Mario.
